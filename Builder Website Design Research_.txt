* Highlight WhatsApp Communication: A prominent WhatsApp button should be included on every page to encourage easy communication and reinforce the "mate" approach. This will make it simple for potential clients to get in touch and experience the agency's friendly and approachable service.
* Informal and Friendly Tone: The website copy should use an informal and friendly tone to resonate with the target audience. This can be achieved through the use of colloquialisms and relatable language, creating a sense of camaraderie and understanding.

This can be done through testimonials from satisfied clients, case studies of successful website projects, or a dedicated "About Us" section that tells the story of the agency and its founder.
* Mobile Optimization: Given the importance of mobile optimization for reaching tradespeople, "gettradesonline.com" must be fully optimized for mobile devices.
