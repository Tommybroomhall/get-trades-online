Why do I need a website when I get most of my work through word of mouth?
‍


‍

Whilst word-of-mouth recommendations are valuable, a professional website acts as a 24/7 portfolio and booking system. When satisfied customers recommend you, the first thing potential clients do is search for you online. Without a website, you might miss out on these pre-qualified leads who already trust you through recommendation. Plus, a website helps you:

Showcase your best work
Display customer testimonials
Make it easy for clients to contact you
Establish credibility in your trade
Expand beyond your immediate network
‍

What is SEO, and why is it important for trades?
SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is how you get found online when potential customers search for services in your area. Think of it as putting your business on the digital high street. Good SEO means:

Your business appears when locals search for your trade
You attract customers actively looking for your services
You build long-term, sustainable business growth
You compete effectively with other local trades
You establish authority in your service area
‍

How long does it take to see results from SEO?
‍


‍

SEO is a long-term investment that builds momentum over time. Whilst every business is different, you can typically expect:

Initial improvements in website visibility within 3-6 months
Significant ranking improvements within 6-12 months
Sustained growth and lead generation beyond 12 months
‍

Remember, whilst SEO takes time, it creates lasting results that continue to benefit your business year after year.

‍

Do I need to be tech-savvy to have an online presence?
Not at all! That's exactly why BUILT exists – we handle all the technical aspects whilst you focus on what you do best: running your trade business. We make it simple by:

Managing all website updates and maintenance
Handling SEO optimisation
Providing easy-to-understand performance reports

‍

How important is Google Business for trades?
‍


‍

Google Business is crucial for local trades. It's often the first thing potential customers see when searching for services in their area. A well-optimised Google Business profile:

Shows up in local search results
Displays your contact information and service areas
Showcases customer reviews and ratings
Features photos of your work
Helps customers find directions to your business
Provides instant credibility
