Key Elements:
Attention-Grabbing Headline: Use emojis and bold statements to stand out in groups.
Value Proposition: Clearly state the £3,000 website, free hosting, and custom build to attract tradespeople.
Urgency: Emphasize limited spots to encourage immediate action.
Call to Action (CTA): Direct users to your website with a clickable link and encourage sharing.
Targeting: Mention trades specifically (e.g., plumbers, electricians) to resonate with your audience in UK trade groups.
Hashtags: Use relevant hashtags to increase visibility, but keep them concise and UK-focused.
Tips for Sharing in Groups:
Research and join active UK trade groups (e.g., on Facebook, LinkedIn) for plumbers, electricians, builders, carpenters, etc. Ensure you follow group rules to avoid being flagged as spam.
Post consistently but respectfully—don’t spam; consider posting once in each group with a follow-up comment or story update if spots are filling fast.
Use Facebook Ads targeting UK tradespeople to boost reach, especially if budget allows.
2. Designing the Website Page
Create a dedicated page on gettradesonline.com (e.g., /freewebsites) to host this campaign. It should be mobile-friendly, clear, and professional. Here’s what to include:

Page Structure:
Header: Bold headline like “Get a FREE £3,000 Website for Your Trade – Limited Spots!”
Subheader: “Get Trades is revolutionizing the industry—claim your custom-built website with free hosting before spots run out!”
Details:
Explain the offer: “We’re offering one free, custom-built website (£3,000 value) with free hosting to one representative from each trade in the UK. Once all spots are filled, the offer ends.”
Highlight benefits: “Tailored design, scratch-built for your trade, no cost, and hosting included.”
Specify eligibility: “You must be a UK-based tradesperson, provide proof of your trade (e.g., business registration, certificates, or photos), and fill out the form below.”
Urgency: “Spots are limited—act fast!”
Contact Form: Embed a simple form (details below) for applicants.
Terms and Conditions: Link to a clear, concise version of the terms (similar to your referral program terms) to cover eligibility, proof requirements, and limitations.
Visuals: Use images or icons of tradespeople, website mockups, or the Get Trades logo to make it visually appealing.
Design Tips:
Use your brand colors (orange, green, etc.) and fonts for consistency.
Ensure the page loads quickly and works on mobile devices, as many tradespeople may access it via phones.
Include a countdown timer or progress bar (e.g., “50/100 trades claimed”) if feasible, to create urgency.
3. Creating the Contact Form
The contact form on the website should collect essential information while minimizing friction for applicants. It should also ensure you can verify eligibility and prevent abuse. Here’s what to include:

Form Fields:
Name: Full name of the applicant.
Business/Trade Name: Name of their trade or business (e.g., “John’s Plumbing Services”).
Trade/Specialty: Dropdown or text field for their trade (e.g., plumber, electrician, carpenter) to track which trades are filled.
Email Address: For communication and verification.
Phone Number: Optional, but helpful for follow-up.
Business Address: To confirm they’re UK-based (e.g., postcode).
Proof of Trade: Upload field for documents (e.g., business registration, trade certificate, photos of work, or invoices). Specify acceptable formats (PDF, JPG, PNG) and size limits.
Consent Checkbox: “I confirm I am a UK-based tradesperson, agree to the terms, and consent to Get Trades processing my data for this offer (see Privacy Policy).”
Form Validation:
Require all fields except phone number to ensure complete applications.
Use CAPTCHA or email verification to prevent bots or spam submissions.
Limit submissions per email/IP address to prevent abuse (e.g., one application per person).
Post-Submission:
Send an automated confirmation email or WhatsApp message (if they provide a number) with next steps: “Thanks for applying! We’ll review your proof and contact you within 7 days if your spot is confirmed.”
Notify applicants if their trade spot is already filled or if additional proof is needed.
4. Addressing Potential Loopoles and Challenges
To ensure fairness, transparency, and prevent exploitation, consider these potential issues and how to address them:

a. Multiple Applications or Fraud
Solution: Limit one application per person (via email/IP tracking) and require proof of trade to verify legitimacy. State in the terms that fraudulent applications (e.g., fake documents, multiple accounts) will be disqualified.
Terms Clause: “Only one free website per tradesperson. Falsifying information or submitting multiple applications will result in disqualification and potential legal action.”
b. Defining “Each Trade”
Challenge: Trades can overlap (e.g., is a “general builder” different from a “bricklayer”?). This could lead to disputes over eligibility.
Solution: Create a clear list of trades you’ll accept (e.g., plumber, electrician, carpenter, painter, roofer, etc.) on the website and form. Use a dropdown menu to standardize responses. Reserve the right to determine eligibility (e.g., “Get Trades reserves the right to define and approve trades at its discretion”).
c. UK Residency Verification
Challenge: Ensuring applicants are UK-based to prevent international submissions.
Solution: Require a UK postcode in the address field and verify it against a database (if feasible). Include in terms: “Applicants must be UK residents with a valid UK business address.”
d. Proof of Trade Requirements
Challenge: Some tradespeople may not have formal certifications or may struggle to provide proof.
Solution: Accept multiple forms of proof (e.g., business registration, trade certificates, photos of work, invoices, or testimonials) and allow applicants to explain in a notes field if they lack traditional proof. State: “Acceptable proof includes business registration, trade certificates, work photos, or invoices. Get Trades may request additional verification.”
e. Limited Spots and Fairness
Challenge: Once spots are filled, you risk alienating late applicants or creating confusion.
Solution: Update the website page and Facebook post in real-time (e.g., “Only 5 spots left!”) or publish a list of filled trades. Notify applicants immediately if their trade is taken. Include in terms: “Once all trade spots are filled, the offer ends, and no further free websites will be provided.”
f. Website Delivery and Expectations
Challenge: Managing expectations for the £3,000 website (e.g., timeline, customization, hosting duration).
Solution: Specify in terms: “The free website includes custom design, development, and 1 year of free hosting. Additional services (e.g., ongoing maintenance, domain registration) may incur fees. Delivery timeline is 4-8 weeks after approval, subject to availability.”
g. Legal and Data Compliance
Challenge: Ensuring compliance with UK laws (e.g., GDPR, consumer protection).
Solution: Include a privacy policy link and consent checkbox in the form. State in terms: “By applying, you consent to Get Trades processing your data for this offer, in line with our Privacy Policy and UK data protection laws.”
5. Terms and Conditions for the Free Website Offer

5. Addressing Potential Loopoles and Challenges Specific to the Trade List
Based on your list, here are additional considerations to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation:

a. Overlap Between Trades
Challenge: Some trades may overlap (e.g., “Building” vs. “Bricklaying,” or “General Handyman” vs. specific trades like “Carpentry”).
Solution: Clarify in the terms and website that Get Trades reserves the right to define and approve trades. Use the dropdown menu to guide applicants, and manually review applications to resolve overlaps (e.g., prioritize the more specific trade if both apply).
b. Proof for General Trades
Challenge: Trades like “General Handyman” may lack specific certifications, making proof harder to provide.
Solution: Accept broader proof for general trades (e.g., photos of general repair work, invoices for multiple trade services) and allow a notes field for explanation. State in terms: “For general trades (e.g., General Handyman), proof may include photos, invoices, or testimonials demonstrating multiple trade skills.”
c. Limited Spots Per Trade
Challenge: Ensuring only one spot per trade is filled fairly, especially if multiple applicants apply for the same trade.
Solution: Process applications on a first-come, first-served basis, with timestamps on submissions. Notify applicants immediately if their trade is claimed, and update the website list in real-time.
d. Scalability and Management
Challenge: Managing 50+ trades could become overwhelming if applications flood in.
Solution: Use an automated system to track submissions, validate proofs, and update the website. Assign a team member to review applications weekly or daily, depending on volume.
6. Promoting and Managing the Campaign
Facebook Strategy: Post in UK trade groups, targeting specific trades (e.g., “Plumbers—claim your free website now!”). Use stories or ads to highlight progress (e.g., “Only 10 trades left!”).
Website Updates: Regularly update the trade list or progress bar to maintain urgency and transparency.
Communication: Use WhatsApp or email to notify applicants, keeping them engaged and informed about their status.
7. Final Thoughts
This trade list provides a solid foundation for your campaign, covering a broad range of UK trades. By integrating it into your Facebook post, website, form, and terms, you can create a fair, transparent, and exciting offer. If you’d like, I can search the web for examples of similar trade-specific campaigns, UK trade group engagement strategies, or legal templates for terms to refine this further.
